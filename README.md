# VBISStaffPortal

Hello and welcome.

The Victoria Brain Injury Society (VBIS) has a dynamic app for their clients, however, they do not have technical backgrounds so updating a database on their own is not the easiest task in the world. This project will create a simpler interface for the staff to update the database from their work station.

This portal will be a website and be hosted entirely through Firebase by Google, conveniently the same hosting service for the VBIS Mobile App database.

I also uploaded pictures under the folder with a jarring title. I will be referencing those images in the future. Check em out


#Firebase Local Hosting SetUp

In the directory of the local repository, write in the terminal:

npm install -g firebase npm install -g firebase-tools

And to locally host the server:

firebase serve

Shift+C to cancel or stop hosting

... More to come.
