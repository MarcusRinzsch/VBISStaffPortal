# VBISStaffPortal

Hello and welcome.

The Victoria Brain Injury Society (VBIS) has a dynamic app for their clients, however, they are not so technically advanced that updating a database on their own is not the easiest task in the world. This project will be an attempt at creating a simpler interface for the staff to update the database from their work station.

This portal will be a website and be hosted entirely through Firebase by Google, conveniently the same hosting service for the VBIS database.

... More to come.
